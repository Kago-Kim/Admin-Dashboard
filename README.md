WHAT I LEARNED

By successfully building this Admin Dashboard, I gained hands-on experience with:

HTML & Semantic Structure → Writing clean, accessible markup to organize dashboard sections (sidebar, header, main content, widgets).

CSS Layouts → Mastering modern layout techniques using CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive and scalable components.

Styling & Theming → Applying design principles (colors, spacing, typography, and hover effects) for a professional UI.

Responsive Design → Making the dashboard adapt to different screen sizes for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Reusable Components → Structuring cards, buttons, icons, and navigation elements in a modular way.

Working with Icons & SVGs → Importing, styling, and resizing vector graphics for UI elements.

Version Control with Git/GitHub → Managing code history and documenting progress through commits and README.

This project strengthened my front-end development skills and improved my ability to transform a design concept into a fully functional, visually appealing interface.
